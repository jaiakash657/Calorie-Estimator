# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Project Overview
**Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation** is a web-based platform designed to empower users to make informed dietary choices. The platform allows users to search for food items by name, providing instant calorie and nutritional information while offering the flexibility to customize portion sizes. Unlike other solutions that rely on AI-based image recognition, this tool focuses on efficient, text-based searches for simplicity and accuracy.
